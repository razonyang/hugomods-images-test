Wow -- this has been quite a year! So far this year:

- The pandemic led to the need for fully remote exams, which mostly use our [ExamTools system](https://exam.tools)
- SignalStuff owner Richard, KD7BBC, changed to half time at his day job (this has always been a side project, did you know?) so he could spend more time on HamStudy and ExamTools development -- all funded by sales from this site!
- We partnered with S&K Antennas to bring you the [Signal Staff](https://signalstuff.com/product/signal-staff-osj/)
- We introduced graduated volume discount pricing for Signal Sticks
- We introduced colored Signal Sticks -- including a fully Glow In the Dark signal stick, because you know you want one ;-)
- And most recently (in the last few weeks) we finally have a vehicle mount super-elastic antenna, the [Signal Stalk](https://signalstuff.com/product/super-elastic-signal-stalk/)!

So, it seems like a good time to celebrate =\] And so we introduce to you the 2020 Black Friday Sale:

* * *

Starting on November 27 until the end of November 30, all Super-Elastic Signal Stick antennas, Super-Elastic Signal Stalk antennas, and all adapters will be 20% off regular price! Unfortunately the Signal Staff OSJ costs too much to make for us to do that, but we'll still be marking it down 10%.

So the prices are:

- Antennas:
    - [Super-Elastic Signal Sticks](/product-category/antennas/signal-sticks/):
        - Black: $20 $16
        - Color: $23 $18.40
        - Glow in the Dark: $26.50 $21.20
    - All-New [Super-Elastic Signal Stalk](https://signalstuff.com/product/super-elastic-signal-stalk/): $32 $25.60
    - [Signal Staff OSJ](https://signalstuff.com/product/signal-staff-osj/): $60.00 $54.00 (or with the mast-mount bracket: $70 $63)
- [All Adapters](/product-category/adapters/): $4 $3.20
    - Note our minimum order requirement of $10

Did we mention that the [HamStudy app](https://ham.study/appstore) will be on sale for 25% off? $3.99 $2.99

This is the only sale we do, so get 'em while they're hot!

Disclaimer: due to a persistent desire not to see our children destitute and living in the gutter, these sale prices *\*will not\** combine with the regular volume discount pricing.
