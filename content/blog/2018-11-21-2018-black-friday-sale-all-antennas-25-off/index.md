From Friday, Nov 23 through Monday, Nov 26, 2018, SignalStuff will be running a Black Friday sale with all antennas 25% off!

For those of you who have participated in previous years sales, you may not know that these are different (better!) antennas than we have sold in previous years; the wire thickness on our dual band model has been increased by 36% but the flexibility remains! Buy one today! (or, well, during the sale, we suppose)

You know you want one. All the cool hams have one.

All antenna sales support development and advertising of [HamStudy.org](https://signalstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hamstudy.org) and related products. [Order one here](https://signalstuff.com/antennas).
