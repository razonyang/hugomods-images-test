# Lifetime warranty

All Super-Elastic Signal Stick antennas are sold with a lifetime warranty. In short, if it breaks then we will fix it. For assistance please email requests to **[orders@signalstuff.com](mailto:orders@signalstuff.com)**.

If the antenna is not working we will sometimes attempt to troubleshoot via email as it is often more efficient than sending things back and forth.  If there is a good story then please include that too for our entertainment =]

## Requirements

If you are requesting a replacement you **_\*must send us a picture of the antenna\*_** before the RMA can be completed. If you aren't sure what is wrong with the antenna the most common things we need pictures of are the connector (preferably at a slight angle so we can see how intact it is) and looking into the connector so we can see the positioning of the center pin. Even if it's not something you can show, we will not send a replacement without a picture.

To request a replacement please email a photo and details to **[orders@signalstuff.com](mailto:orders@signalstuff.com)**

## Limitations for customers from outside of the United States

Unfortunately, international shipping is so expensive that we have to limit international warranties. The following restrictions apply for all international customers:

* For international customers the warranty will only cover factory defects, not accidental damage or breakage due to antenna wear and tear.
* Unless the antenna arrived defective or damaged you will need to cover shipping costs for the replacement.

We are very sorry for the inconvenience — I wish I could fully support markets outside of the US, but I am unable to do so at this time.
