In a world where Amateur Radio ought to be on the cutting edge of technology, far too often hams are seen as being “old school” and “behind the times.” There's no part of the hobby where this is more painfully obvious than in that of amateur radio license study and examinations.

SignalStuff is dedicated to enhancing the use of technology in amateur radio licensing. With our free website [HamStudy.org](https://hamstudy.org) we provide software which finally gives aspiring hams and those wanting to progress in the hobby intelligent tools that help them cover the material faster and remember it more effectively.

With its sister site [ExamTools.org](https://examtools.org) we give VE teams the software they need to be able to give exams with integrity and efficiency, whether online or using paper. (For more information about ExamTools.org, check out our youtube walkthrough.)

Unfortunately, free crusades like this are hard to fund and maintain. This website and the products it sells are what make that possible. Every single antenna we sell was assembled by hand by members of the amateur radio community.

**Thanks for supporting HamStudy.org!**
